# Global FWI Analysis
An increase in fire activity in the Amazon Rainforest region could have detrimental effects on the local and global climate. With this in mind it is crucial to be able to accurately forcast increases in fire weather, both short and long term. To aid in this goal this project provides more important information to accurately forcast the region. I accomplish this by using a global FWI dataset from the past 40 years to estimate a yearly trend and estimate the correlation between el nino events and fire weather change in the region.
